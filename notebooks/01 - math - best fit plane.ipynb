    "The difference in the \\(d\\) value between the **projection-based determinant approach** and the **SVD method** arises from the way each method defines the best-fit plane and handles the data. Letâ€™s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Projection-Based Determinant Method**:\n",
    "- **What it does**:\n",
    "  - This method computes least squares regressions for projections onto the XY, XZ, and YZ planes.\n",
    "  - The plane with the largest determinant (\\(\\text{det}(A^T A)\\)) is selected as the best projection for regression.\n",
    "  - After selecting the projection, it solves the regression problem \\( A \\cdot x = b \\) to find the coefficients \\(a, b, c, d\\), then normalizes \\(a, b, c\\).\n",
    "  - The \\(d\\) value is derived from the regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it fits the plane**:\n",
    "  - It is influenced by the projection selected (e.g., XY, XZ, or YZ).\n",
    "  - The resulting plane minimizes errors in that particular projection (e.g., minimizing errors in the \\(z\\)-coordinate when using the XY projection).\n",
    "  - This causes a bias in the computation, as it prioritizes minimizing errors along one specific axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact on \\(d\\)**:\n",
    "  - The \\(d\\) value is not a purely geometric property but is computed relative to the chosen projection. This can lead to a discrepancy when compared to more global fitting methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **SVD Method**:\n",
    "- **What it does**:\n",
    "  - SVD computes the plane that minimizes the orthogonal distances of all points to the plane in 3D space.\n",
    "  - It treats all dimensions (X, Y, Z) equally without prioritizing any specific axis or projection.\n",
    "  - The normal vector is derived from the smallest singular value, which corresponds to the direction of least variation in the point cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it fits the plane**:\n",
    "  - This method ensures that the plane minimizes the total orthogonal distance from all points to the plane in a least-squares sense.\n",
    "  - The \\(d\\) value is computed based on the centroid of the points and the normal vector:\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    d = -(\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\text{centroid})\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact on \\(d\\)**:\n",
    "  - The \\(d\\) value in this method represents the offset of the plane from the origin when the normal vector is normalized.\n",
    "  - It is inherently a global property of the plane and is unaffected by any single projection, leading to differences compared to the projection-based method.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Difference in \\(d\\) Occurs:\n",
    "1. **Projection Bias in Determinant Method**:\n",
    "   - The projection-based approach introduces bias by solving the problem in 2D (e.g., XY plane), which minimizes errors along one axis but ignores orthogonal errors.\n",
    "   - The \\(d\\) value in this method depends on the chosen projection and the axis-specific regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Orthogonality in SVD Method**:\n",
    "   - The SVD method works in 3D and minimizes the overall orthogonal distances from points to the plane.\n",
    "   - This makes the \\(d\\) value a globally optimized parameter, leading to different results from the determinant method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Numerical Differences**:\n",
    "   - Even when normalized, numerical approximations (e.g., slight differences in floating-point calculations) between these methods can lead to small discrepancies in the coefficients, especially in \\(d\\), which depends directly on the normal vector and the centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which is \"Correct\"?\n",
    "- **SVD Method**:\n",
    "  - Provides a mathematically rigorous solution for minimizing orthogonal distances and is generally preferred for least-squares plane fitting in 3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Projection Method**:\n",
    "  - Can be useful if you are specifically interested in the plane along a particular projection (e.g., minimizing errors in the \\(z\\)-axis for a top-down view).\n",
    "\n",
    "The \\(d\\) value difference is a result of the fundamental difference in the plane-fitting criteria of the two methods. The SVD method treats all dimensions equally, while the determinant method does not."
