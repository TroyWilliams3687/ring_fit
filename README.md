## Introduction

## QuickStart

1. [Install UV]
2. Build Virtual Environment: `uv sync`
3. [Activate](#activate-virtual-environment---traditional-approach)

## Install UV

This environment is setup to be managed by [UV](./uv.md). It makes life so much easier.

### Activate Virtual Environment - Traditional Approach

You can add the following alias to your **.zshrc** or **.bashrc**, or you can run the activate script directly:

```bash
# Python Virtual Environment Alias
alias activate="source .venv/bin/activate"
```

>NOTE: On Windows, there is an **activate.ps1**, a PowerShell script that you can execute.
